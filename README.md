Written in 2006 it seems going by the date stamps on the file.

I was using ultraedit apparently, under windows.

I wrote it to practice ear training. I was dissatisfied with the ear
training software going around at the time and combined the features
of several. But not knowing java or javascript or any other language
than c/c++, basic and pascal I found it hard to hook up to the midi
hardware in the soundblaster cards.

But with [keykit](http://nosuch.com/keykit/) it was easy. It is c like
I remember and easy to learn. And I remember the program was complete
and working well. 

The keykit included is for Windows and every few years I manage to get
it running. There is a linux version and I'll include the instructions
to get it running on windows and linux one of these days.
