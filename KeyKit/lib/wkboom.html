The
<b>Kboom</b>
tool is a drum pattern editor that has taken on a life of
its own - it has a lot of features that are a lot of fun to play with.
It displays a grid where each row represents a drum and each column
represents a step.
The drums, however, are not restricted to single notes that trigger
drum sounds.  A "drum" can be set to an arbitrary MIDI message,
or even a complete phrase.  New drums can be added and set on the fly,
while the pattern is playing.
<p>
The menu button at the left end of each row will reveal a list of
drums.  The default drum list is appropriate for a General MIDI synthesizer,
but if you want you can change this list by editing the
<font  class="fixed" >lib/maps.k</font>
file as appropriate for your situation.
<p>
To use an arbitrary MIDI note as a drum, just play the note on your
MIDI input device, and then invoke the
<b>"Use Rec'd Note/Chord"</b>
item in the menu button for one of the rows.  From then on, cells in that
row will trigger the note that you just played.  The same method can be
used to set the drum to a complete chord rather than a note.  In essence,
all notes that overlap the last-played note will be grabbed and used
as the drum.  If you want to use a phrase (i.e. several notes in sequence),
just play the phrase on your MIDI input device and then invoke
<b>"Use Rec'd Phrase"</b>
in the drum's menu button.  This will look backwards in time for the
first two-beat space - everything played after that space will be
taken as the "phrase" that will be used for that drum.
Another way to set a drum note is to invoke
<b>"Use Snarf,"</b>
in which case the current contents of the Snarf buffer will be used.
<p>
When you set a drum value using MIDI input or via the Snarf buffer,
the label on the drum button will show a "constant phrase" representation
of the value.  To change this label, invoke the
<b>"Set Label"</b>
item in the drum button menu.  You will be prompted to enter the text
for a new label.
<p>
The
<b>More</b>
menu in the Kboom tool controls a variety of things.  The
<b>Snarf</b>
item will grab a copy of the current drum pattern and put it into the
Snarf buffer (for use in other tools).  The
<b>Clear</b>
item will clear all of the cells in the drum grid.
The
<b>"Read Drumkit"</b>
menu item will read a file that initializes the drum set.
An example of the file that
<b>"Read Drumkit"</b>
uses can be found in the
<font  class="fixed" >lib\*(Esdrums.kbm</font>
file - it is an ASCII file that specifies the channel, pitches, and labels
for the drums.  You can use a text editor to create other such files,
making it easy to use a particular set of drums without having to
set them up manually with the drum buttons.
<p>
The
<b>Flash</b>
item lets you turn off the flashing indication of the current beat
at the top of the Kboom tool.  Turning it off may be appropriate if
you have a slow machine, or if there is just too much activity on
your screen.
<p>
Instead of having each step be
just on and off, you can use
<b>"More->Toggle Mode->Gradual"</b>
to turn 
on a mode in which each cell can be filled in gradually.  If a cell is filled
in 250f the way, then that "hit" of the drum will only occur
25% (randomly) of the time.  This can add variety to a pattern.
Another way of adding variety is to create a second
<b>Kboom</b>
tool with
a different number of steps, and playing the two patterns at the same
time.
<p>
The
<b>"# of Drums ->"</b>
and
<b>"# of Steps ->"</b>
items in the
<b>More</b>
menu let you change the number of rows and columns in the grid.
The
<b>"Shift ->"</b>
item lets you shift the entire contents of the grid, forward and backward.
The shift is done in a circular fashion, so no drum hits are actually lost.
