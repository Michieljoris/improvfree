<tool name="Group" class="wgroup">
The
<b>Group</b>
tool is very much like a standard multi-track sequencer.
It allows flexible editing of music, and is the most important (and largest)
tool provided in the user interface of KeyKit.
<blankline/>
The
<b>Read</b>
item in the
<b>File</b>
menu lets you read things into the Group tool.
For example, the
<b>"Read->Standard MIDI File"</b>
item will prompt you for the name of a Standard MIDI File.
<b>"Read->Snarf"</b>
will load the Group tool with the current contents of the Snarf buffer.
<b>"Read->Recorded"</b>
will load the Group tool by looking at the
<b>Recorded</b>
variable, which records MIDI input.  If you choose the
<b>"(2b space)"</b>
variation of this item, the Recorded MIDI input will be searched backwards
until a two-beat space is located, and all MIDI input from that
point forward will be grabbed and loaded into the Group tool.
Likewise for the
<b>"(8b space)"</b>
variation, except that it looks for an eight-beat space.
<blankline/>
The Group tool maintains a set of tracks.  The merged contents of
all tracks is always displayed in the track named
<b>Merged.</b>
The
<b>View->Tracks</b>
menu item controls what tracks are displayed.
For example, selecting
<b>View->Tracks->All</b>
will cause all tracks to be displayed.
Other items in the
<b>View</b>
menu control the region (time-wise) of the music that is displayed.
For example,
<b>View->In</b>
lets you zoom in to get more detail.
After invoking
<b>View->In,</b>
you are expected to sweep out an area within one of
the tracks in the Group tool.
The mouse cursor will change to a left-right arrow, to give you
a reminder that you are expected to sweep out a horizontal area.
The area you sweep out will then fill the display.
<blankline/>
The
<b>View->Pan</b>
item lets you move left and right within the phrase.  After invoking
<b>View->Pan,</b>
you are then expected to press the left mouse button and drag the mouse.
You will see the phrase within the Group tool move left and right as
you drag the mouse left and right.
<blankline/>
New tracks can be added with the
<b>"File->Add Track"</b>
menu.  For example, a new blank track can be added with
<b>"File->Add Track->Blank."</b>
If you play back some part of the music in the Group tool, and
play something along with it on your MIDI input device,
you will often want to add your overdubbed input as a new track.
This is done with with
<b>"File->Add Track->Last Overdub."</b>
Note that you don't have to do anything in preparation for adding an
Overdub track.  Every time you play back something in the Group tool,
KeyKit is recording MIDI input, and if you happen to play something
you like, you can immediatly save it as a new track.
<blankline/>
At the upper-left corner
of each track (including the merged track) is a menu button, and the
menu it reveals is called the
<b>"track menu."</b>
The
items in a track menu apply only to the corresponding track.
For example, the
<b>Unshow</b>
item in the track menu will cause that
track to be removed from the display (though it still exists, and its
music will still be shown in the
Merged
track.  The
<b>Showonly</b>
item will cause only that track to be display (in addition to the
Merged
track, which is always shown.  If you want to go back to seeing only
the
Merged
track, select
<b>Showonly</b>
in the track menu for
the
Merged
track.
<blankline/>
The text within the track menu buttons are the track names.
You can change a track name by using the
<b>Label</b>
item in the track menu.
<blankline/>
Within each track window, the 2 mouse buttons (left and right) are used
for a variety of operations.  Instead of being fixed, the
meaning of each mouse button can be changed, and in practice you should
expect to change their meanings often.
The meanings of the mouse buttons are assigned with the 3 menu buttons
in the upper-right corner of the Group tool.
Each mouse button actually has three meanings - one when the
shift key is pressed, one when the control key is pressed, and one when
no keys are pressed.
The keys that can modify the mouse button meanings are called "modifiers".
The leftmost of the 3 menu buttons in the upper right corner of the
Group tool controls the "modifier" that currently applies
to the other two menu buttons - the modifier value can be
<b>Normal,</b>
<b>Shift,</b>
or
<b>Control.</b>
When the modifier is set to
<b>Shift,</b>
then the other two menu buttons will control the meanings of the left and right
mouse buttons when the Shift key is pressed.  Likewise, when the modifier
is set to
<b>Control,</b>
then the other two menu buttons control the meanings of the mouse buttons
when the Control key is pressed.  And when the modifier
is set to
<b>Normal,</b>
then the other two menu buttons control the meanings of the mouse buttons
when no key is pressed.
The label of each button reveals the current meaning
of that mouse button (for the current modifier setting).
To change the operation of a button, you select the
operation you want from the corresponding mouse button menu, and from
then on that mouse button (combined with the appropriate modifier)
will perform that operation.
<blankline/>
The default operation for the left mouse button, when a Group tool is
first created, is
<b>"Aud Sweep"</b>
(where
<b>Aud</b>
is short
for
<b>Audition</b>
).
This means that when you press and drag the left mouse button within a track
window, you will be sweeping out the audition area.  Try it, making sure
that the mouse is within a track window when you start sweeping.  While you
sweep, you will see vertical bars that indicate the audition area.  When
you release, there is no visible indication of the current audition area
(though someday there probably should be).  The default operation
for the right mouse button is
<b>"Aud Play"</b>
- to play the current
audition area.
So, if you use the left mouse button to sweep some part of the music,
and then press the right mouse button, you should hear that music
played via MIDI output, and you should see the notes flash as they play.
To stop the playback, press the right mouse button again.  This shows that
<b>"Aud Play"</b>
is a toggle - it starts and stops playback.
<blankline/>
Now, try changing the meaning of the left mouse button.  Use the
menu button labeled
<b>L:,</b>
and select
<b>Pick->Sweep.</b>
From then on, the left mouse button
will sweep out the current
<b>Pick.</b>
The term Pick refers to the
selected notes of the music that will be affected whenever an Edit operation
is used.  Try using the left mouse button to sweep an area of the music.
After you sweep, you should see the notes in that area turn red.  The notes
of the current Pick are always drawn in red.
<blankline/>
The
<b>View->In</b>
menu item lets you zoom in to get a closer look at the
music.  After you select this item, the mouse cursor will change to
a left-right arrow, meaning that you are then expected to sweep out an
area within one of the tracks.  Do this.  You should see the display redrawn
with that area of the track filling the display.  Note that
<b>View->In</b>
changes the meaning of the left mouse button only temporarily - it then
reverts to the operation specified in the
<b>L:</b>
menu button.
<b>View->Out</b>
will return to viewing the entire piece of music.
<blankline/>
Zoom in on part of the music, so that you can easily see individual notes.
Pick a few notes (i.e.
make sure the left mouse button is set to
<b>Pick->Sweep,</b>
and then sweep the notes).
Now, select
<b>Edit->Delete,</b>
and the notes in
the current Pick will be removed.
Do it again - pick some more notes and delete them.
Now, select
<b>Edit->Undo.</b>
You will see your last deletion undone.
Select
<b>Edit->Undo</b>
again, and you will see your first deletion undone,
so your music is back to its original state.  The
<b>Undo</b>
operation can
undo the last 32 editing operations, by default, and you can easily increase
this number, subject to memory limitations.
<blankline/>
The
<b>Edit->Undo</b>
item is one of the most common menu items to pull off
and make into a real button.  It's important to realize that when you do this,
that
<b>Undo</b>
button will only affect the Group tool from which you
pulled it - it will not affect any other Group tools that are on the screen.
This is true of any of the buttons that you pull from menus in any
given tool.  There is currently no visible or other indication of the
relationship between pulled-off buttons and the tools they control,
so it's obviously a good idea to position the buttons
in ways that make it obvious as to which tool they belong.
