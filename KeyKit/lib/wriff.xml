<tool name="Riff" class="wriff">
The
<b>Riff</b>
tool is a simple utility for playing and recording phrases.
It has no real editing functions - that role is filled by the
<b>Group</b>
tool.  The Riff tool is useful for looping phrases (repeating them
endlessly), and is often used as a target of the
<b>Bang</b>
tool.

The
<b>"Load Rec"</b>
item in the
<b>More</b>
menu will load the Riff tool with the most recently recorded MIDI input.
If you select
<b>"Load Rec (1b space),"</b>
it will look back in time to find the first one-beat space, and will
load the Riff tool with all MIDI input recorded after that.  The
<b>"Load Rec (4b space)"</b>
does the same thing except it looks for a four-beat space.
The
<b>"Load From Snarf"</b>
and
<b>"Load from File"</b>
items in the
<b>More</b>
menu let you load the Riff tool from the Snarf buffer and from
a Standard MIDI File, respectively.

After loading a phrase into the Riff tool, you can play it by clicking the
mouse button anywhere within the phrase window.  Clicking the mouse again,
while the phrase is playing, will terminate playback.  The
<b>Loop</b>
button is a toggle switch - if you turn it on, the phrase will be
played repeatedly until you explicitly terminate it, either by turning the
<b>Loop</b>
mode off or by clicking the mouse within the phrase window.

The
<b>"Loop Quant->"</b>
item lets you select the value by which the loop repeat time will be quantized.
For example, if the Riff tool contains a phrase whose length is not
exactly a multiple of 4 beats, you will probably want to set the loop
quantization value to 4b.
Similarly, the
<b>"Start Quant->"</b>
item lets you select the quantization value used whenever the riff
is started.

The
<b>Snarf</b>
item in the
<b>More</b>
menu will put the current phrase into the Snarf buffer.
The
<b>Strip</b>
item will strip the current phrase - all leading and trailing space (rests)
will be removed.
