<tool name="Remapper" class="wremapper">
The
<b>Remapper</b>
tool lets you map incoming MIDI input to a specific scale.
The scale being mapped-to is controlled by the global variable <b>Mapto</b>,
whose value should be the name of a scale in the Scales array
(e.g. "newage" or "fifths" or "ionian" or "dorian" or ...).
The key of the scale is controlled by the global variable <b>Key</b>,
which should be a single note (e.g. 'c', 'a', 'e-', ...).

The GUI interface to this tool lets you set the MIDI channel that
will be remapped, and lets you turn the mapping on and off.
