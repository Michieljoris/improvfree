<p/>
The
<b>Echo</b>
tool is a realtime utility.  When you turn it
<b>On</b>
(the
<b>On</b>
button is a toggle switch), all MIDI input will be echoed to MIDI output.
The default settings will echo each MIDI input note with a delay time
of one beat, but you can control the delay and other factors by moving
the sliders.  The
<b>time</b>
slider controls the delay time between echos.  The
<b>trans</b>
slider controls the pitch transposition of each echo.  For example, if the
<b>trans</b>
slider is set to 7, then the echoed notes will be transposed 7 steps up
(i.e. a fifth).  Likewise, a value of -7 will transpose a fifth down.
<p>
The
<b>vol</b>
slider controls the volume decay.  For example, if it is set to 50%, then the
volume of each echoed note will be decreased by 50 percent.
<p>
The
<b>ntimes</b>
slider controls how many echoes are generated.  For example, if it is
set to 4, then each input MIDI note will be echoed 4 times.  If the
<b>vol</b>
slider was set to 50%, the volume of the 4th echo would be 1/16 the volume
of the initial note.  Also, if the
<b>trans</b>
slider was set to 2, then the pitch of the 4th echo would be 8 steps
above the original note.
<p>
Since KeyKit is multi-tasking, it is possible (and great fun) to create
multiple
<b>Echo</b>
tools and have them operating simultaneously, with different settings in each.
<p>
There is also an
<b>EchoInfinite</b>
tool that works just like the Echo tool, but which echoes forever
(or until each note's volume reaches 0).
