The "Burn" tool is a simulator for the "Stars of Lyra"
installation that Tim is building for Burning Man 2003.

The following describes how to use and write "lighter" modules
for the Burn tool.

---------------------------------------

First create the tool with Tools2->Burn.

You'll see the Lyre, surrounded by 4 simulated
"dance pads".  Press the START button on any of the dance
pads, and you should here music start playing,
and the "strings" of the lyre will start flashing.

You can select Music files with the Music menu - it should
show the files in your .../music directory.   You can
use "More->Add File" to browse for any MIDI file on your
system and add it to the Music menu.

Use the "Lighter" menu to control which "lighter module"
is being used.  Here's a description of some of the
first few lighter modules:

    pitch scaled - pitches of the music are scaled to
                   fit across the 24 strings

    pitch modulo - pitches are used more directly to
                   light the strings, and the pitch values
                   are "modulo 24" so that all pitches
                   will map to one of the strings.

    scan1        - When no music is sounding, the strings
                   will scan back and forth.  Every time
                   a note plays, the direction of the
                   scanning is reversed.

    scan2        - Switches direction on every beat

    scan3        - Scans the strings in from each side,
		   switching on each note.

    scan4        - Scans where the speed of the sweeps
                   are dependent on the length of the notes.

Each "lighter module" is a file containin a class whose name
starts with lyre_lighter_, and the rest of the name is the
name of the module (e.g. the "scan1" module is contained
in lyre_lighter_scan1.k )

The lighter module class should contain some conventional
methods for

	activate()
	start()
	stop()

	notefunc()  - invoked for every note played or looped.

	beatfunc()  - invoked for every beat, at least when
			playing files.
	padfunc()  - invoked when buttons on the dance pads are pressed


To add a new "lighter module", just add a new file to the lib
directory, with a name lyre_lighter_*.k, and it should show up
in the "Lighter" menu in the Burn tool.

-----------------------------------------------------------------

LOOPING
-------
If you set the Player to "looper" (rather than "playfile"), and then
start punching the various buttons on the dance pads, the notes
should start looping.  As they loop, they will fade out.
Various controls in this mode:

	Press START to stop the looping of each pad.

	Hold down START for a longer time to stop all looping.

	Press SELECT to get more notes.

	Hold down SELECT for more than 1 second, and then
	press any other pad (on the same dance pad) to select
	a different sound for that pad.
