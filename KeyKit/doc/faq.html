<li ><b>What is this thing?</b>
<p>
KeyKit is both a programming language and a complete graphical environment
containing a large variety
of tools for both normal "sequencing" tasks as well as "algorithmic
composition" tasks.
The KeyKit download site can be found <a href="http://www.nosuch.com/keykit" >here</a>.
</li>
<p>
<li ><b>Do I need to do any programming to use it?</b>
<p>
The graphical environment is complete enough to be easily used
without doing any programming at all, and can be used to do a large
variety of manipulations in a MIDI environment.  The system, however, is
designed very much from a programmer's perspective.  It is designed
to make it easy to add new tools and features, often with only
a few lines of KeyKit code.
For example, adding a new editing operation to the Group tool
(the multi-track sequencer) can be done with 4 lines of code.
See below for how to do this.
</li>
<p>
<li ><b>I've lost my password for the download site, what do I do?</b>
<p>
Just register again with your same email address, and the new password
you will be sent will override the old one.
</li>
<p>
<li ><b>How do I get started?</b>
<p>
You should read the HTML documentation that comes with the system.
</li>
<p>
<li ><b>How can I have the most fun with the smallest amount of effort?</b>
<p>
The <b>Mouse Matrix</b> tool is the simplest tool that you can have immediate
(though perhaps brief) fun with.
The <b>Kboom</b> tool is a drum pattern editor that is both a lot of fun
and *very* deep in capability.
</li>
<p>
<li ><b>What is the "Snarf"?</b>
<p>
Snarf is a single global variable that many tools
can set and/or get, much like the clipboard on Windows.
If you see a "Snarf" menu item in a tool, selecting that
menu item will save the current contents of the
tool in the Snarf variable.  You can then go to another
tool, and use "Load->Snarf" (or whatever menu item the
tool provides for reading the Snarf).  For example,
the Group tool has a "File->Read->Snarf" menu item.
<p>
Besides being able to Snarf midi phrases and use them between tools,
you can also Snarf an entire tool and its contents
(with Window->Snarf Tool) and then create any number of
copies of that tool (with Window->Paste Tool).
Besides the obvious use, this can be useful to 
copy a tool to a new page.
</li>
<p>
<li ><b>How can I write a MIDI file?</b>
<p>
The Group tool has a "File->Write->Standard MIDI File" menu item.
So, typically, you copy things to a Group tool in order to write them
out as a MIDI file.
However, you can also write a MIDI file from the console, or in a script,
using the writemf function like this: writemf(Snarf,"file.mid");
</li>
<p>
<li ><b>What is the "console" for?</b>
<p>
After starting KeyKit, you can type statements
in the "console", but this is typically only
used for:
<ul >
<li >
Invoking functions that are defined
by the files in the <b>lib</b> and <b>liblocal</b> directories.
</li>
<li >
Using "#include" to re-read a file
after making a change.
</li>
<li >
Debugging (for example, typing
"print Snarf" will print the current
value in the Snarf variable).
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<p>
<li ><b> How can I write and execute my own programs in KeyKit?</b>
<p>
The usual way of writing KeyKit code is to
use the text editor of your choice on a file
in the <b>liblocal</b> directory (say, "foo.k"), and when
you want to execute that code (or load the
function it defines) you type
<pre>

     #include foo.k
</pre>
in the KeyKit console.  Typically such a file will just
define a function, and you can then execute it
interactively from the console.  For example,
if the foo.k file defines functions foo1() and
foo2(), you could then type statements like this at
the console:
<p>
<pre>

     foo1()
     Snarf = foo1()
     Snarf = foo2() + foo1()
</pre>
<p>
The first statement will actually schedule
and play the return value of foo1(),
assuming that the return value of foo1()
is a phrase.  The second and third statements
will assign values to the global Snarf variable,
which is used as a conventional mechanism for
transferring values between the GUI tools.
For example, you could use "File->Read->Snarf"
in the Group tool (the multi-track editor)
to view and play the results of your foo1() function.
</li>
<p>
<li ><b>How can I use KeyKit for sysex dumps?</b>
<p>
There is no GUI tool for this, but sample code
for this can be found in lib/realutil.k -
the getsysexdump() function is well-commented.
The txpatches() and txperfs() functions use
getsysexdump() for getting patch and performance
dumps from a Yamaha TX81Z.
</li>
<p>
<li ><b>How do I add a new editing operation to the Group tool?</b>
<p>
Let's say you want to add an editing operation that will shift the
currently-picked notes up one octave in pitch.  You would add
1 line to the <b>lib/mkmenus.k</b> file, in the <b>mkmenu_edit()</b>
function, like this:
<pre>

     o.menucmd("Octave Up ->",po,"edit","cmd_octaveup")
</pre>
and then add a <b>cmd_octaveup()</b> function to the <b>lib/cmds.k</b>
file like this:
<pre>

     function cmd_octaveup(p) {
          p.pitch += 12
     }
</pre>
That's it!
And you can do this <b>while KeyKit is running!</b>.  Just
make the additions described above, then type these statements in the
console:
<pre>

     #include cmds.k
     #include mkmenus.k
</pre>
The Group tools on your screen will <b>immediately</b> have access to the
new editing operation.
Obviously if you want sub-menus and other things, it isn't
quite that simple, but you can use the existing commands as samples of
what to do for more complex new commands.
</li>
<p>
<li ><b>How well does it work on Linux?</b>
<p>
KeyKit works on Linux, but only with external MIDI devices (using the
/dev/midi device driver).  Internal sound devices are not supported.
If Linux developers write better support for MIDI, this might change.
</li>
<p>
<li ><b>How do you use KeyKit in CGI and other scripts?</b>
<p>
"lowkey" is a version of the KeyKit interpreter that
does not have graphics support, suitable for use
from CGI and other scripts.
Here's an example of using lowkey in a CGI script.  Write the KeyKit code
you want to execute, and put it into a file, defined as a function.
For example, put this in "foo.k":
<pre>

     function foogen(n) {
          # Repeat C chord n times, as an example
          p = repeat('c e g',n)
          # Write the result as a standard midi file, in foo.mid
          writemf(p,"foo.mid")
     }
</pre>
Then execute lowkey like this:
<pre>

     lowkey foo.k -c "foogen(4)"
</pre>
This lets you write the function once and call it in different ways
from your CGI script.  When you invoke lowkey, you either need
to be in the bin directory, or you need to set the KEYROOT
environment variable to the directory in which you've
installed keykit.
