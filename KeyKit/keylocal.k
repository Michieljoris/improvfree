# To control your "local" configuration", you can create a file
# named c:\keylocal.k (ie. in the root directory of the drive you
# are running keykit from), and put a function keylocal() in it.
# That function will be executed when keykit starts, and you 
# can set things like the default MIDI input/output ports, etc.
#
# This is a sample.  You should copy this file to c:\keylocal.k
# and then edit it as needed.  The Contribdir, if set, is where things
# like GeoMaestro will be located.

	# end of the boot process, by using addprerc and addpostrc, like this:
	#addprerc(global(localprerc))
	#addpostrc(global(localpostrc))

	# To enable GeoMaestro, install the GeoMaestro directory in Contribdir
	# (c:\contrib by default, see above), and then
